In this section, I learned about some basic classifier, such as KNN, SVM and Softmax with linear model.

I also learned about back-propagation and simple neural network.

Furthermore, I try to coding in a vectorized method, so that speed up the running time.

For me, the computation of gradient with complex loss function and vectorized coding is a little difficult.
